# UFOs

## Overview of the Project

Developing a web application dedicated to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The project is requested by a journalist interested in the UFO topic, who wanted to provide data-driven support to the findings in her articles. 

### Deliverables: 

1. Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
2. A report on the UFO analysis

### Tools and Data Sources

#### Tools

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap framework

#### Data Sources

- [UFO Sightings Source Data](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-online/module_11/data.js)

## Results

### Web App (Filters & Data)

![WebApp-1](/Resources/WebApp-2.png)

### User Instructions

The App provides the following search criteria to pull the UFO sightings data:

1. Date - the date of the sighting
2. City - the city of the sighting
3. State - the state of the sighting
4. Country - the country of the sighting
5. Shape - the UFO shape

To open the App, connect to the following link: [levflevine.github.io/UFOs](https://levflevine.github.io/UFOs/)

Once the WebApp is initially open, a user can see the entire current dataset of the UFO sightings in the US from 1/1/2010 until 1/13/2010.

The dataset includes the following data points documented by the Journalist:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country 
- Shape
- Duration, and 
- Comments

To narrow it down, it is necessary to enter the filter criteria in the fields in the "Filter Search" section that is on the left from the data table.

Once any of the filters are entered, modified, or deleted, the event listener in the app automatically updates the content of the table to match the active filters. 

## Summary

### A drawback of the design

There are a few areas for improvement in the current App design:

1. A user cannot enter a Date Range filter, only single dates can be selected
2. There is not an opportunity for users to submit their evidence of new UFO sightings to add to the dataset
3. There is no contact information in the App to reach out to the Journalist
4. Users need to scroll down the page to get to the data section while there is too much free space at the top left side of the screen 
5. The Comments column of the data table is too narrow: in the Mobile Device view, the space is not used efficiently
6. There are no links to the UFO Associations / Organizations for further research of interested users
7. There is no Feedback section to leave user comments & suggestions

Also, the data has a few drawbacks: 

1. The data only inlcudes a small set of UFO sightings for the period of Jan 1 - Jan 13 2010. 
2. There are not photo or video evidence in the dataset
3. The Comments are not detailed enought

### Recommendations for further desigh development

1. Enable a filter for Date Range
2. Enable a feature for users to submit their evidence of new UFO sightings that can be added to the dataset
3. Add contact information to the App so that the users can reach out to the Journalist
4. Add links to the filter section and/or position the filter at the top left side of the page, where there is much free space
5. Expand the Comments column of the data table
6. Add links to the UFO Associations / Organizations for further research of interested users
7. Add the user feedback section

The dataset can also be improved as follows:

1. Make it up to date by adding more sighting events and details 
2. Enhance the dataset with photo and video evidence 
3. Provide more detailed comments and descriptions of the UFO sightings and observation circumstances
